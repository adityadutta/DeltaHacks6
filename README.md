This Project was created for DeltaHacksVI at McMaster University.
Our Inspiration was the recent forest fires that have occured in Australia, Brazil, California. 
We decided to make a two part system for our project : 
   1. A hardware component that took the data realtime and stored it in google's Firebase platform. 
   2. We created a Machine Learning Model and trained it to predict if there was going to be a fire.
